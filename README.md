Squareboat assessment for Full stack dev

You can find the app live here -> https://jolly-jang-877111.netlify.app/

I started my project with this Github repo - https://github.com/Tushar-Developer/Squareboat-job-website (this repo is 100% latest).You can find all the commits related to the 
development of this project. 
When I started the project I made 2 folders one as the frontend and the second as the backend. And later on, while deploying the app on Heroku I found that the backend should be as the root folder so I had to change my deployment method. I deployed my backend at Heroku(link to that - https://squareboat-job-website.herokuapp.com/) and my frontend at netlify(link to that - https://jolly-jang-877111.netlify.app/).
